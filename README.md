# Trading Algorithm

- I am using genetic algorithms to find the best offspring that will bring in the maximum returns.
- I am training 2 populations in parallel, one for short only and the other for long only trades.
- The ideal allocation beats the market both in terms of return and risk adjusted
- My purpose is to get as close to the ideal allocation and deploy my trading bot live.

This repo contains mupltiple pieces of code that are not necessarly related to the final version of the Bachelor thesis. 
My thesis was exploratory.
